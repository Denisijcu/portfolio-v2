                <p>I studied Industrial electronics, but I have been working in programming my whole life. This history
                    begins since 1991 when I started learning the language of programming Basic, Pascal and C. After
                    that continued with the DataBase like DBASE III, with Clipper and later Foxpro for MS DOs, Also
                    Borland Delphi. Later on with the #Net continue with Visual Studio, specially with Visual Foxpro
                    and C#. I let some important projects in Cuba about accounting.</p>
                <p>I migrated to USA in 2009 and I stoped to programming but for my own I continued learning online new
                    technologies. I learned Java first with Eclipse and later with Android Studio. I built some apps
                    for androids.</p>

                <p>Later I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript with the library Jquery and Bootstrap and also built some
                    apps for all devices.</p>

                <p>Lastly I learned Angular for web and Nativescript and Ionic for Movil. I never stop to learn. I have
                    taken
                    other courses in Udemy such us: NodeJs, ExpressJs, React, Native React, The Modern Javascript,
                    Materialize, Bootstrap and also Python and Django. Even the new Flutter of Google to build cross
                    platform. </p>
                <p> Today I have some certifications of Udemy of the most updated courses in programming is concerned.</p>
